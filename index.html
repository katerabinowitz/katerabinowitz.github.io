<p>I'm a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/kate-rabinowitz" class="link">Graphics Reporter</a> at The Washington Post. Finding the stories in messy data is my passion.

<br><br>

Previously, I was a Data Fellow at <a href="https://www.propublica.org/people/kate-rabinowitz" class="link">Propublica</a>.

<br><br>

A couple years before that I created <a href="https://www.datalensdc.com/" class="link">DataLensDC</a> to tell DC's stories with data. It quickly grew from a hobby to a part-time and then full-time job.

<br><br>

I like to <a href="./talks.html" class="link">teach and talk</a>. Maybe more importantly, I like to <a href="http://wespeaktoo.org/" class="link">lift the voices</a> of others.

<br><br>

In my free time I co-captain <a href="https://codefordc.org/" class="link">Code for DC</a> and co-organize <a href="http://techladyhackathon.org/" class="link">Tech Lady Hackathon</a>. Sometimes I make <a class="link" href="https://katerabinowitz.github.io/dog-name-game/">silly</a> <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/BiodiversityBot">things</a>.

<br><br>

People have written some kind <a href="./recognition.html" class="link">words about me</a>. I've even won some <a href="./recognition.html" class="link">awards</a>.
